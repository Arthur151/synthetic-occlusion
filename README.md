# synthetic-occlusion

In deep learning for computer vision, augmenting input images with synthetic occluders is an effective regularization method.

This is the implementation we used for our IROS Workshop paper [1], and for achieving first place in the 2018 ECCV PoseTrack Challenge on 3D human pose estimation (method description and results can be found in [2]).

## Dependencies

* Python 3, Numpy, OpenCV 3, Pillow

## Usage
0. Make sure Python 3, Numpy, OpenCV 3 and Pillow are installed.
1. Download and extract the Pascal VOC training/validation data from http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/#devkit
2. Use the `SyntheticOcclusion` class as show in the `main` function.
